"Oscillation, cooperativity, and intermediates in the self-repressing gene",,,"intense_study ",,,,"biological_oscillation ",,,,,1662309419535302656,,,custom_license,"Biological oscillators are vital to living organisms, which use them as clocks for time-sensitive processes. However, much is unknown about mechanisms which can give rise to coherent oscillatory behavior, with few exceptions (e.g., explicitly delayed self-repressors and simple models of specific organisms' circadian clocks). We present what may be the simplest possible reliable gene network oscillator, a self-repressing gene. We show that binding cooperativity, which has not been considered in detail in this context, can combine with small numbers of intermediate steps to create coherent oscillation. We also note that noise blurs the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior.",005f37ed7fb9d0a45b613c2b3bc1bdbafc4f26ed,,"Biological oscillation and its mechanisms have recently become a subject of intense study by a number of experimental and theoretical groups. Its study is still in the early stages, and while the phenomenon itself is believed to be of great importance, knowledge of mechanisms by which it can occur is quite incomplete. Oscillation is used in a number of biological systems, most notably in the circadian rhythms responsible for keeping organisms' biochemical processes in line with the day-night schedule of the Earth. A number of mechanisms can be used by organisms to give a reasonably coherent oscillation, including three-gene repressilator systems [1] [2] [3] , self-repressors with maturation times or other explicit, deterministic time delays (as opposed to intermediate steps which would result from a full treatment of chemical intermediates) [4] [5] [6] [7] , more complex negative feedback loops tied to population dynamics [8] combined repression and activation loops [9] , highly non-linear protein degradation [10] , very large numbers (hundreds) of intermediate steps [11] , and self-repressors whose production and gene repression involve diffusion through the nuclear membrane [12, 13] . A self-activator with one stable and one metastable state, and stochastic switching between the two, can cause what may be called incoherent oscillation [14] . Additionally, certain kinds of self-repression can cause behavior which is not coherent oscillation when one considers the deterministic average protein and mRNA concentrations, but which still appear quite oscillatory and reasonably coherent when one considers any given system's stochastic trajectory through protein and mRNA concentration space over time [15] . This last example is of particular interest because in part of its simplicity; it is an uncomplicated system, easily modelled using straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. 1 There is, however, another reason for interest in the work. The binding mechanism suggested by the mathematics presented by McKane and Newman in Ref. [15] is in fact a combination of multiple n-mer bindings of regulatory proteins to the gene. In addition, the which n contributes most to the genetic activity here depends on the single parameter which McKane and Newman used to tweak their system and the average number of proteins present in the system. While this in itself may be non-physical, it inherently suggests that the number of bound proteins may be able to change the system from non-oscillatory to oscillatory with noise to (possibly) oscillatory even without noise. We note that the simplest possible version of this last suggestion, a deterministic model with mRNA and with n regulatory proteins binding directly and instantaneously to the gene, cannot be oscillatory. A brief proof of this is included in the section on linear stability analysis (however, the stochastic version of the system can have oscillation-like behavior, and we explore this briefly). 1 Deterministic time delays of the type t À s; the most common method used to get a simple self-repressor to oscillate, can reproduce most results from other methods. However, for stochastics they require non-Markov simulation. Furthermore, while the equations are straightforward, the authors know of no way to determine a priori the numerical values of time delays that substitute for the delaying steps. The methods outlined in this Letter, in contrast, are purely Markov and involve only the actual chemical rates of the represented processes.

The following were constant for all calculations: the degradation rate of mRNA k m ¼ 1 (hence, s m ¼ 1); the degradation rate of monomer protein k p ¼ 1 (hence, s p P 1); the rates of gene binding and unbinding x ) 1 (and so the system is very adiabatic); the ratio of the nmer dissolution constant f to the formation constant h is ; the rate of n-mer dissolution f ) 1 in the simplest case, Fig. 1 , and f ¼ 1 in all other calculations; the number of complete n-mers which will cause the gene to be repressed by a factor of 1=e, X eq ¼ 10; the protein synthesis rate from a single strand of mRNA g p ¼ 3; and the ratio of mRNA synthesis in the repressed versus the unrepressed gene state g 0 ¼ g 1 =100. It should be noted that g p and X eq can be rescaled in systems without internal noise; only when the actual number becomes important, as opposed to relative concentrations, does do these quantities have any significant effect other than a rescaling. It should also be noted that the ratio s p =s m is in rough agreement with the average for this sort of gene in yeast, given as approximately 2 in Ref. [16] . Deterministic calculations (involving the average numbers of mRNA, proteins, and protein aggregates) used the simple set of equations where m is the number of mRNA molecules, P off ðP on Þ is the probability or fraction of the time that the gene is repressed (unrepressed), p is the number of monomer proteins, and c is the number of n-mer proteins in the system at time t. Simple modifications made additional intermediate steps possible (c becoming c 1 , n becoming n 1 , additional terms in the last equation for the n 2 c 1 ! c 2 step, the extra equations for c 2 in terms of c 1 and c 3 , etc.). We should also note that we assume all binding steps involved are fast compared to the other processes involved in the system, though binding events are relatively rare, and binding is highly cooperative. Slower binding, or binding that is less cooperative, can introduce very different elements to a system, as shown in Ref. [17] . The authors used time-series data to determine the oscillatory nature of the systems. A general solution to the linear stability analysis of the system would involve analytically solving an n þ 1-degree polynomial with non-integer parameter-dependent coefficients, which is infeasible [18] . Even numerical solutions to the linear stability analysis problem alone could have glossed over complex behavior less useful to an organism than regular oscillation (i.e., chaos). However, individual points in different regions identified by the time-series data have been checked numerically using linear stability analysis. In the regime noted as 'oscillatory' via the time-series data, the Jacobian at the equilibrium point has one real negative eigenvalue and two complex eigenvalues with positive real parts, confirming that the point can be oscillatory. Outside that region, all three eigenvalues' real parts are negative, confirming the non-oscillatory classification. We note that the line between the zones labeled 'decaying oscillation' and 'no oscillation' is much less well-defined than the line between those labeled 'oscillation' and 'decaying oscillation', as a system which displays decaying oscillation given one set of initial conditions can have no oscillations with another set of initial conditions. However, we believe the general trend is correct and useful, and so we indicate the distinction in the figure. Stochastic calculations were straightforward, using the following equations: R monomer protein degradation ¼ k p p: In the calculations for Fig. 1 (in which binding to the gene is coupled with n-mer formation), we used derived from the standard master equation rates of binding hpðp À 1Þ Á Á Á ðp À n þ 1Þ and unbinding f. For other stochastic calculations, in which the proteins bind to each other before binding to the gene, we used instead R nÀmer formation ¼ hpðp À 1Þ Á Á Á ðp À n þ 1Þ; R nÀmer breaking ¼ fc: A time-step dt was then calculated using these rates, ensuring that events generally occurred one at a time by using (this is subtly different from the traditional Gillespie simulation in that multiple events were in theory allowed, if quite unlikely; however, the difference is very small and may reasonably be considered to be an advantage of our algorithm.) For practicality's sake, at very high levels of synthesis, multiple synthesis and decay events were allowed and occurred in the background of other events, but were kept to at most a 0.01% mean change in the number of molecules. Each process was then treated as a Poisson process using the same dt, with the probability of a events of type b occurring being e ÀR b dt ðR b dtÞ a a! . Fig. 1. (a) Stochastic calculation of coherence in a system which has mRNA and proteins cooperatively binding to the gene, with coherence given by 2 P Hðd/Þ P jd/j À 1 where d/ is the difference in angle in mRNA-protein space. (b) Stochastic calculation of the standard deviation of the period distribution divided by its mean. Both colormaps are on the same scale as Fig. 3 . The programs used were written in C, and run using FEDORA 10 LINUX on a Dell desktop computer. We present, as an aside, a brief proof of the non-oscillation of the system described without delays. This system is described by the equations dm dt ¼ Àk m m þ g 0 þ g 1 À g 0 1 þ p n =X eq ; dp dt ¼ Àk p p þ g p m: The Jacobian of the system is given by with eigenvalues that add to a real negative number and multiply to a real positive number. If the eigenvalues are complex, due to the result of multiplication they have the same real part. Due to this and the result of the addition, both eigenvalues must have negative real parts, meaning oscillation is impossible. If the eigenvalues are real, both must be negative, again making oscillation impossible. It should be noted that we made these conclusions based on the structure of the Jacobian without finding the fixed point, based on the fact that there are only two eigenvalues. The more complex cases described in this work would have three or more eigenvalues, which would make finding the fixed point necessary. They also add to the complexity of the equations for finding the fixed point, which are already of degree n þ 1 with multiple terms and noninteger coefficients. We begin with the stochastic system described first, in which binding to the gene is coupled with n-mer formation (this could be either because the binding to the gene is itself cooperative or because it is very fast once the n-mer is formed). In the described regime, whose deterministic solutions yield at best decaying oscillation, we now explore the possibility of noise-induced oscillation. We note that the system in this case is between truly oscillatory and simply two-state with reasonably frequent switching. Simple two-state switching would lead to a 'period distribution' (time between maxima) with a normalized standard deviation of that period rt t of 1 ffiffi 2 p . Fig. 1b shows rt t , and Fig. 1a shows the coherence (generalized from the definition used in Ref. [2] ). Coherence is defined as 2 P t Hðd/ðtÞÞ P t jd/ðtÞj À 1 where / is the angle in mRNA-protein space from the average concentration, and d/ðtÞ ¼ /ðtÞ À /ðt À 0:1Þ. It is, in essence, a measure of how often a system goes forward (clockwise) instead of backward (counterclockwise) in its oscillation. Both the coherence and rt t strongly imply that increased cooperativity yields a steadier oscillatory behavior, but that in the regions explored there is no coherent oscillation (which would require a coherence close to 1 and a value of rt t significantly less than 1). So far, the only pieces of the puzzle considered have been multimer binding of proteins to genes, mRNA, and noise. We now add the final piece, the possibility of proteins binding together before they bind to the gene. The number of steps involved here keeps oscillation from occurring at a cooperativity of 1, but increased n causes oscillatory behavior when combined with the rest of the system. Specifically, Fig. 2 shows a stochastic system with n ¼ 16 and the distribution of periods, defined here as time between local maxima in protein number which are at least 0:4 Á s mRNA (in order to remove less significant fluctuations from consideration). This system is clearly oscillatory, with a reasonably sharp period distribution. It should be noted that 16 is at best a marginally reasonable value for cooperativity in a simple genetic system. However, it is clear now that simple intermediate steps can interact with cooperativity, and between them can produce oscillations in which neither is the primary factor in the behavior. Furthermore, examining the parameter space in more detail, we find telling behavior in both deterministic and stochastic cases. Fig. 3a shows the deterministic phase diagram of the system, made using timeseries calculations. Region I is oscillatory, region II displays decaying oscillation, and region III is non-oscillatory. High cooperativity and synthesis rate are both clearly necessary for this; also, it should again be noted that the additional intermediate step as compared with the system from Fig. 1 is necessary for deterministic oscillation. In Fig. 3b , we see, in the same region, a graph of the coherence. It corresponds well with the deterministic calculations: the system reliably goes in the correct direction (associated with time going forward) in the stochastic case when its parameters would predict that it is deterministically oscillatory. Fig. 3c shows rt t , which again corresponds well, although not perfectly; some loss of specificity in period at very high cooperativity and synthesis implies that the oscillation may be imperfect or require that other parameters be very specific at some level. However, the increase in rt t at these points is slight. From these figures, it is apparent that coherence is possible with higher rates of synthesis, and that there is a tendency towards higher coherence with higher cooperativity. Additionally, we note that in the stochastic case there is no jump in coherence or rt t as we would find if the system exhibited the phase-transition behavior from the deterministic system, Fig. 3a ; in the stochastic case ( Fig. 3b and c) , the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory is blurred. It is important to note that noise alone is not sufficient for reliable or even semi-reliable oscillation. The deterministically oscillating region clearly has more stable oscillation in the stochastic regime, and systems close to it are more capable of reliable behavior than those far away from it. For comparison, we now choose a point in the region of deterministic decaying oscillations, and make plots comparable to Fig. 2. In Fig. 4 we see a system whose behavior seems similar in many ways; the main difference in this case is a slightly widened period distribution. While this system is definitely in region II of Fig. 3a (with a cooperativity of 8) , and the period distribution may be too wide for a truly accurate clock, it is obvious that the line between coherent oscillation and incoherent oscillation-like behavior is blurred in this case by noise. We see in these figures that the optimal cooperativity for this number of intermediate steps in binding is still, at best, at the very high end of cooperativity in reasonable biological systems. Therefore, we have attempted a less complete search of parameters considering additional steps (instead of monomer to n-mer, monomer to dimer to tetramer, etc.). While our searches were not exhaustive, we found at least one region in which such a system can oscillate at quite reasonable values for n, as low as 8 (octamer). For reference, this is not an uncommon amount of cooperativity for these sorts of proteins. SARS-CoV nsp10, for instance, forms a dodecameric structure (n ¼ 12) [19] ; Rhizobium leguminosarum NodD has been shown to bind to DNA preferentially in octamer form [20] ; and k phage CI, while it has a small autoregulatory effect with tetramer and even dimer forms, only fully represses itself when an octamer form of the protein links distant sites on DNA together [21] . Our data show that oscillation occurs when cooperativity and intermediate steps are both present, when neither cooperativity nor intermediates would otherwise be sufficient. More, it implies that, with many intermediate steps, lower cooperativity can yield oscillation, while with higher cooperativity fewer intermediate steps are necessary. Oscillation behavior in deterministic calculations gives rise to more stable oscillation in the stochastic case. Additionally, it should be noted that, even though we found no coherent oscillation for lower values of cooperativity, moderate coherence in an oscillation-like behavior may not necessarily be detrimental to a biological system which relies on it as a clock for functions which are not truly vital. Many biological clocks receive input of some kind from outside sources, whether light and food for 24-h clocks or some other form [22, 23] . These inputs can reset a biological clock, and one may argue that they might be able to do so more easily in a fundamentally inexact clock than a single-mode oscillator. In summary, we have discovered a relationship between generally realistic intermediate steps (as opposed to set-time time delays of the form t À s, which are realistic for a limited set of systems), cooperativity, and oscillation. Intermediate steps result- region I is oscillatory, region II has decaying oscillations, and region III is non-oscillatory. Due to the fact that the distinction betweeen II and III is somewhat dependent on initial conditions, there may be some overlap between those two regions as discussed in the Methods section. (b) Stochastic calculation of coherence, given by 2 P Hðd/Þ P jd/j À 1 where d/ is the difference in angle in mRNA-protein space. (c) Stochastic calculation of the standard deviation of the period distribution divided by its mean. ing from slow cooperative binding can cause oscillation at biologically relevant cooperativity. We have also explored the noise effect, in which the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory (relatively clear in the deterministic case) is blurred in the stochastic case."

Then, it is difficult to understand why a fraction of the normal translocations (25%) occur and another fraction of the ""uncoupled"" translocations (75%) occur. Moreover, as the ""uncoupled"" translocation involves no reverse intersubunit rotation, then how the ""uncoupled"" translocation occurs is unclear. In addition, since after EF-G release from State R2 (Fig. S1 ) the state becomes similar to State R5 (Fig. S1) , why EF-G.GTP cannot bind to State R2 and then catalyzes the reverse intersubunit rotation whereas EF-G.GTP can bind to State R5 and then catalyzes the reverse intersubunit rotation is not clear. Available experimental data (Chen et al., 2013; Takyar et al., 2005; Qu et al., 2011) and analyses (Xie, 2014a; 2014b) indicated that the 30S subunit of the ribosome covers about 12 bases (four codons) of the single-stranded mRNA from its P site to the mRNA entry site. Thus, when the 30S P site is occupying GCA 21 codon of the wild-type mRNA used in the experiments of Chen et al. (2014) , the G 34 :C base pair is just outside the mRNA entry site (see Fig. S2b ); and when the 30S P site is occupying AAA 24 codon, three G:C base pairs in the mRNA stem loop are unwound (see Fig. S2c ). Moreover, it is considered that when the 30S P site is occupying GCA 21 codon, the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (anti-SD) of 16S rRNA is in the same position of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence of the mRNA along the translation direction (see Fig. S2b ). Under this consideration, we study the probability of the effective translocation during translation of each codon on the mRNA. (i). During the translation of codons before codon GCA 21 , no downstream mRNA base pair is required to unwind during the translocation step and moreover, since the anti-SD is far away from the SD, there is no the SD:anti-SD interaction. Thus, no resistance is present to hinder the translocation, as during the translation through the single-stranded mRNA, giving the probability of effective translocation, (1) E P = 1. (ii). During the translation of codon GCA 21 , the translocation (from Fig. S2a to S2b) also requires no unwinding of mRNA base pair. Moreover, the SD:anti-SD interaction facilitates the translocation. Thus, the reverse intersubunit rotation gives a 100% probability of the effective translocation. (iii). During the translation of codon AAA 24 , the translocation (from Fig. S2b to S2c) requires unwinding of three G:C base pairs, giving an increase in free energy of 3E bp , and moreover, due to the SD:anti-SD interaction the translocation (from Fig.   S2b to S2c) also gives an increase in free energy of Thus, the effective-translocation probability (1) E P can be calculated by Eq. (S2) is the same as Eq. (19). As shown in Section 3.4, we have (1  As determined in Section 3.1, E bp = 2.5k B T. As determined previously (Xie, 2013) , (24), it is seen that even with the second term of Eq. (24) being negligibly smaller than the first term, this (1) E P = 0.82 that is slightly smaller than 1 gives the mean rotated-state lifetime T R2 to be slightly larger than T R1 , which is consistent with the experimental data [see, e.g., Figure 1d and Extended Data Figure   5c -f in Chen et al. (2014) ]. (v). During the translation of codon AGU 30 , the translocation requires unwinding of two U:A base pairs and one G:C base pair, giving an increase in free energy of ( : ) "

These are referred to as ""unknowns,"" and reflect the vast unexplored microbial sequence space of our biosphere, also known as ""biological dark matter."" However, unknowns also exist because metagenomic datasets are not optimally mined. There is a pressure on researchers to publish and move on, and the unknown sequences are often left for what they are, and conclusions drawn based on reads with annotated homologs. This can cause abundant and widespread genomes to be overlooked, such as the recently discovered human gut bacteriophage crAssphage. The unknowns may be enriched for bacteriophage sequences, the most abundant and genetically diverse component of the biosphere and of sequence space. However, it remains an open question, what is the actual size of biological sequence space? The de novo assembly of shotgun metagenomes is the most powerful tool to address this question. Metagenomics is the untargeted sequencing of genetic material isolated from communities of micro-organisms and viruses. These communities may be derived from bioreactors, environmental, clinical, or industrial samples; in short, from anywhere in our unsterile biosphere. The classical questions in metagenomics that are asked about the sampled microbial community are ""Who is there?"" and ""What are they doing?."" 1 Originally an approach to answer these classical questions, metagenomics as a field has made great progress in the past decade. Applications include the use of metagenomics for the discovery of novel genetic functionality, 2 for describing microbial ecosystems and tracking their variation, 3 in untargeted medical diagnostics and forensics, 4 and as a powerful tool to determine the genome sequences of rare, uncultivable microbes. 5 Powered by advances in next-generation sequencing technology, metagenomics has the potential to venture beyond the limits of currently explored sequence space by sampling environmental microbes and viruses at an unprecedented scale and resolution. Quite literally, sequence space is defined as the multi-dimensional space of all possible nucleotide (or protein) sequences. 6 Sequence space contains n dimensions; one dimension per residue that can take one of 4 (or 20, for proteins) states, with a total volume of S4 n sequences when summed over all possible sequence lengths n. Evolution may have largely explored this space, 7 but it remains an open question how large the current biological sequence space is, i.e. the fraction occupied by extant life. Figuratively, and within the context of this paper, ""outer sequence space"" is the remainder of this biological sequence space waiting to be explored by science. Metagenomics has traditionally addressed the 2 classical questions listed above by aligning the sequencing reads in metagenomic data sets to a reference database containing known, annotated sequences. This allows the taxonomic and functional diversity of the sampled microbes to be described in terms of existing knowledge, allowing for straightforward interpretation of the results. However, a persistent concern in the analysis of metagenomes has been the unknown fraction, consisting of the reads Keywords: biological dark matter, crAssphage, human gut, human virome, metagenomics, metagenome assembly, unknowns that cannot be annotated by using database searches. The level of unknowns can range up to 99% of the metagenomic reads, depending on the sampled environment, the protocols used for nucleotide isolation and sequencing, the homology search algorithm, and the reference database. 8 Unknowns exist for 4 reasons that are not unrelated. The first reason is technical. Due to limitations of some next-generation sequencing platforms and library preparation protocols, spurious sequences may be generated that do not reflect true biological molecules. These artificial sequences include artifacts due to the sequencing technology 9 and chimeras, i.e., sequences generated from separate genetic molecules derived from different organisms. Since chimeras frequently arise during PCR amplification, they are expected to be more abundant in environmental amplicon sequencing than in shotgun metagenomics, and can be detected using bioinformatic tools. 10 The second reason that unknowns exist is biological, as they reflect the enormous natural diversity of microorganisms that we are only beginning to unveil with metagenomics. This is both overwhelming and exciting, highlighting how much remains to be discovered in biology. This genetic diversity has been referred to as biological ""dark matter,"" 11, 12 and is especially pronounced in viral metagenomes. 8 This issue can only be resolved by expanding reference databases, as exemplified by recent studies of one of the most studied microbial ecosystems: the human gut. The first metagenomic snapshots of the microbiota in the human gut were taken from 2 healthy adults, and revealed a high interindividual diversity and many unknowns. 13 To a large extent, these unknowns were resolved when a reference catalog was created based on the sequences in the gut metagenomes themselves, decreasing the percentage of unknowns from »85% to »20%. 14 Moreover, subsequent large scale sequencing efforts revealed that in fact, many people share a similar intestinal flora, regardless of whether these similarities are viewed as discrete enterotypes 15 or as gradients. 16 These results illustrate how unknowns can be depleted by expanding the databases with appropriate reference sequences. This not only requires increased sequencing effort of phylogenetically diverse isolates 17 or single cells, 11 but also mining of draft genomes from metagenomes, 18 sampled from microbial environments around the globe. 19 Thus, by mapping the global sequence space, we can provide reassurance that at least some level of sampling saturation can be achieved. For viruses, and particularly for bacteriophages, efforts to provide a denser sampling of sequence space are still lacking. The third reason that unknowns exist is methodological. Because the advances in DNA sequencing technology have greatly outpaced improvements in computer power, 20 bioinformatic approaches to analyze metagenomes often cut corners. For example, reference databases may be reduced to include only those references that are expected in the sample a priori. Moreover, read annotation may be limited to identifying almost exact sequence matches, as this can be computed much faster than if sequence variations needs to be taken into consideration in a permissive homology search. These issues lead to an inherent blind spot for discovering true novelty, such as sequences that are not expected in the sample, or organisms that have not been observed before. One way to, at least partially resolve this issue is by de novo assembly of the metagenome. Depending on the diversity of the sample, assembly can combine many short sequences (individual reads) into fewer, longer ones (assembled contigs). Reducing the number, and increasing the length of the sequences allows homology searches to be performed with more sensitive, computationally more expensive algorithms such as translated homology searches or profile searches, leading to more specific annotation and improved biological interpretation. Moreover, larger and more comprehensive reference databases can be used, allowing unexpected hits to be found. The fourth reason that unknowns exist is logistical. Most research projects that generate metagenomic sequencing datasets deposit the read files in large repositories, provide an accession number in the associated publication, and move on. It is not unlikely that many of these data sets, consisting of files sometimes gigabytes in size, are never looked at again. Thus, while a certain sequence may have been ""seen"" in a metagenome and is thus strictly no longer ""dark matter,"" it will still not be recognized when it is observed again. Reidentification of this sequence would only be possible if the publishing researcher identified it as an interesting sequence in his or her (assembled) metagenome, and submitted it to a searchable database like Genbank. 21 Because GenBank maintains very high standards for the sequences it accepts, submission can be a tedious process that is rarely worthwhile for unknown metagenomic contigs. An in depth investigation of the unknowns is rarely within the scope of a research project, and those sequences are thus first ignored and later forgotten. This is a waste of valuable resources: time, money, and work. The metagenomes available in public databases should be better exploited and mined for common sequences. To facilitate this, it is critical that metadata annotations of the metagenomes include a detailed description of the samples and sequencing protocol. 22 Exploiting these datasets will allow us to create more comprehensive maps of sequence space, and greatly improve our understanding and interpretation of metagenomes. In the short term, ignoring the unknowns can facilitate the interpretation of a metagenome. Because a taxonomic or functional description cannot be provided, the classical questions in metagenomics are left unanswered for the unknown fraction of the metagenome, and concentrating on the annotated sequences leads to a more straightforward answer. However, unexpected or novel sequences are quickly overlooked, even if they represent highly abundant or widespread organisms. Thus, in the long term, stockpiling the unknown sequencing reads in badly accessible bulk sequence repositories can severely slow down research, the discovery of novel species, and the charting of biological sequence space. One striking example of a novel genome discovered among the unknown sequences is crAssphage, a bacteriophage whose genome uniquely aligned sequencing reads from 73% of the 466 analyzed human gut metagenomes, and constituted a total of 1.68% of those metagenomic reads. 23 Like many bacteriophages, its genome sequence is highly divergent from everything that was present in the annotated part of the Genbank database, which is why it was not observed before. It has been suggested that the unknown fraction of metagenomes is enriched for viral sequences, 8, 24 because viral genomes are thought to evolve more rapidly than the genomes of cellular organisms, allowing them to explore a larger region of sequence space in the same amount of time. To summarize, unknowns are genetic sequences that are difficult to identify using standard methods, such as by alignment to an annotated reference database. Unknowns remain a persistent elephant in the room in most metagenomics research projects, and exist for technical, biological, methodological, and logistical reasons. The most promising option to resolve the unknowns is by creating improved reference databases that chart biological sequence space, including the outer realms that remain unexplored by science (also known as dark matter). Besides sequencing reference strains or single cells, it may be expected that metagenomic sequencing, assembly, and binning will greatly add to improving these reference databases, for example by identifying common sequences in many metagenomes, and prioritizing them for targeted characterization. Characterizing unknowns will be vital to fully exploit the increasingly available metagenomic data sets from all ecosystems, toward understanding the roles of microbes and viruses in the biosphere. It remains an open question what is the actual size of biological sequence space, but the untargeted, shotgun nature of metagenomics makes it the most powerful tool to address this question."

METHODS Orientation of helices with respect to the lipid phase probed by paramagnetic relaxation,,,,,,,"a_doxyl_paramagnetic_radical_(spin_electron) ",,,,,1662317037719912448,,,commercial_use,"Longitudinal relaxation of 1 H N spins enhanced by the proximity to a paramagnetic probe can be used to map the orientation of helices respect to the lipid phase [1] . Due to the compact arrangement of the six 15 N-labeled amino acids near the center of the transmembrane helices, the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) should reflect the distance of the corresponding 1 H N to the surface of the pentameric assembly, provided the employed paramagnetic probe is primarily localized at the center of a micelle. We selected a 16-DSA, which typically induces PRE near the center of DPC micelles carrying a membrane protein [2] . Following the theoretical guidelines outlined by Zangger and co-workers[1], we derive below an analytical expression for the dependence of PRE on the shortest distance of 1 H N to the lipid-exposed outer surface of the ETM channel. For paramagnetic probes where the unpaired electron has a short longitudinal relaxation time, the influence of the unpaired electron on nuclear relaxation (both longitudinal and transverse) can be described by the ""outer sphere"" relaxation approach [3]. In order to obtain an expression for PRE as a function of geometric parameters, we performed a volume integration shown in Equation (1). In this equation, the probability of finding a paramagnetic center in a particular volume element of the system formed by ETM, detergent and 16-DSA, is multiplied by the inverse of the 6 th power of the proton-electron distance, r, and integrated[1].",610adc2e0b9fea5bdaa4ea21b46e4bd6b02d558d,,"To ETM in DPC, we added the lipid analogue 16-DSA, bearing a doxyl paramagnetic radical (spin electron) at position 16 of the alkyl chain. This resulted in a measurable PRE effect that was linearly proportional to the concentration of 16-DSA in the range 1 mM to 5 mM. In this calculation, the ETM system can be described as a pentameric α-helical bundle (Fig. S3 , A), represented by a cylinder with radius R b , aligned with the z-direction of the laboratory coordinate frame. This cylinder is embedded in a spherical micelle of radius R, and integration should be limited to the volume of the micelle accessible to the probe, V. This volume comprises the core and inner layers of the micelle, i.e., a fraction a of the total micelle volume. The nuclear spin is localized at the immersion depth d (Fig. S3, B) from the surface of the bundle accessible to the paramagnetic probe. For the sake of simplicity, Eq. (1) can be approximated as PRE = a/d 3 , where a is a collection of various fundamental constants. R b is defined by a rolling-sphere approach, with sphere radius of 3 Å, corresponding to the size of the doxyl radical (Fig. S3, D) . Alternatively, PRE can be calculated using a distance from the amide proton to the axis of the pentamer (Fig. S3, C) . The position of this axis can be defined with greater precision than the immersion depth from the surface of the pentamer. In this case the equation can be simplified to PRE = a/(D/2-l) 3 , where a is a collection of various fundamental constants, D is the diameter of the cylinder representing the pentamer and l is the distance from the C 5 symmetry axis to the amide proton.

At this time, the nucleophilic attack of the NHC-zwitterionic species II to the electrophilic C 3 -keto carbonyl site of NUS-isatin forms second zwitterionic species III followed by proton transfer towards the elimination of free-NHC to form aldol-type condensation product α-diazo-β-hydroxy ester 7aj.

The equation above describes the components of the STL model, where Yi is the element of the original time series (e.g. influenza A and H5 monthly detection data), Ti is the element for the trend variation which can be describes as low frequency variation in data along with nonstationary, consistent changes in level. Si represents the seasonal component consisting variations in data within each seasonal frequency, here the length of each cycle is 1 year. The remainder (Ri) component consists of the data not explained by the trend and the seasonality.

Alignment-free similarity analysis for protein sequences based on fuzzy integral,,,,,,,"a_given_decision_threshold_(figure ",,,,,1662315042696069120,,,commercial_use,The goal of the study is to build an Alignment-free tool for sequence clustering. To demonstrate the efficiency of our method we compared the phylogenetic trees and the distance matrices generated by our method with the other freely available recent methods [1] . The superiority of the clustering performance of our method can be noticed in the following trees. We can see the superiority of efficient clustering of the sequences across all the benchmark datasets as compared to the other methods.,425007062aa63b14681dcf2414a0f5b77bca5ddd,,": Accuracy classification of AUC [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . A low AUC value does not necessarily suggest a bad or poor model; rather it simply suggests that, besides the accounted predictors, other factors also exercise influence on the response variable. It is evident from the ROC plots below that our method's performance is in good agreement with other methods. In summary, our method performs similarly in terms of statistical measurements (ROC and AUC) with the other methods. However, the phylogenetic trees generated by our method and the other freely available recent methods [1] shows superiority of our method over the other methods in terms of sequence clustering. The phylogenetic tree is generated by a distance matrix which is equal to (1-similarity matrix), equation (12) in our manuscript. We took similarity matrix for ROC analysis. In similarity matrix, we assigned positive label, if the two sequences belong to same class (i.e., family level classification, phylum level classification, genus level classification, etc.,) otherwise assigned negative label. We generated the ROC curve by varying decision threshold between the minimum and maximum values of the similarity matrix and plotted the FPR (false positive rate) on X-axis and TPR (true positive rate) on Y-axis. Each point in the ROC curve corresponds to a discrete classifier that can be obtained using a given decision threshold (Figure 3 in [7] ). After plotting ROC curve, we calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Phylogenetic tree on NADH Dehydrogenase 5 (ND 5) protein sequences. The phylogenetic tree ( Figure 1 ) generated by our method successfully clustered sequences belonged to family Hominidae which includes human, pigmy chimpanzee, common chimpanzee and gorilla in one clades and outgrouped opossum, which is missing in phylogenetic trees generated by other freely available tools [1] (Figures 2,3 ,4,5 and 6). This shows the advantage of our method over others in terms of sequence clustering. Moreover, the AUC of our method is 0.97 (Figure 7 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( Phylogenetic tree on NADH Dehydrogenase 6 (ND 6) protein sequences. The phylogenetic tree ( Figure 8 ) generated by our method successfully clustered sequences belonging to family Hominidae which includes human, common chimpanzee and gorilla in one clades, which is missing in phylogenetic trees generated by other freely available tools [1] (Figures 9,10,11,12 and 13), which again shows the advantage of our method over others in terms of clustering. The AUC of our method is 0.98 ( Figure 14 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( Table 1 ) and approximately same with other AUC's. 50 Coronavirus sequences were divided into four groups (Figure 15 ), where group I and II contains mammalian coronaviruses, group III contain avian coronaviruses and group IV contain SARS-CoVs. The phylogenetic tree (Figure 15 ) generated by our method put sequences belong to group I close to each other, which is missing in phylogenetic trees (Figures 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20) generated by other freely available tools [1] . Rest of the groups are properly clustered by all the methods. This shows the advantage of our method over others in terms of clustering. The AUC of our method is 0.96 (Figure 21 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( Phylogenetic tree on 50 Beta-globin protein sequences. The phylogenetic trees constructed by our method (Figure 22 ) successfully clustered mammalian beta-globin protein sequences and primates in separate clades which are not observed in phylogenetic trees generated by other freely available tools [1] (Figures 23,24,25,26 and 27). This shows the advantage of our method over others based on clustering. The AUC of our method is 0.91 ( Figure 28 ), which indicates that our method has high accuracy ( Phylogenetic tree on 24 Transferrin protein sequences. The phylogenetic trees constructed by our method (Figure 29 ) clustered sequences from mammalia in a separate clade which was not observed in phylogenetic trees generated by other freely available tools [1] (Figures 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 ). This shows superiority of our method. Similarly, AUC of our method is 0.85 (Figure 35 ), which indicates that our method has moderate accuracy (Table 1) and similar with other AUC's. Phylogenetic tree on Xylanases protein sequences in the F10 and G11 datasets. The above trees generated by our method and the other freely available recent methods [1] shows superiority of our method in terms of clustering over other methods. The sequences we used were Xylanases proteins from two different families F10 and G11. The tree generated by our method (Figure 36 ) distinctly clusters two families in two different clades, which is missing in all the other trees ( Figures 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41). This shows the advantage of our method over others. Similarly, AUC of our method is 0.89 (Figure 42 ), which indicates that our method has moderate accuracy ( Table 1) ."

The beam from a 532-nm green laser (75 mW, CL532-075-L, CrystaLaser) was attenuated by a half-wave plate and a beam splitter before expanded 10 through a pair of convex lenses. A 2-inch iris was installed to cut the blur rim of the expanded Gaussian beam, which was focused on the back focal plane of a 100 oil immersion objective (UAPON 100XOTIRF, NA = 1.49, Olympus) by a 2-inch diameter, 300-mm focal-length convex lens. The lens position was adjusted to tune the reflection angle to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of fluorescence. In the microscope, the emitted light was separated from the excitation beam by a dichroic mirror (FF562-Di03-25x36, Semrock) and then passed through a dual-band emission filter (FF01-577/690-25, Semrock). A homebuild dual view system, containing another dichroic mirror (FF650-Di01-25x36, Semrock), was used to separate the signals from donor and acceptor dyes, which were imaged on an EMCCD camera (iXon DU-897D, Andor).

With baseline carriage rates of 50% (expected based on prior data from our model), 73 participants in each arm were required for 80% power to detect a 50% relative increase in pneumococcal acquisition at any time point, after 10% drop-out. Describe any data exclusions. Of 130 vaccinated volunteers, five were natural pneumococcal carriers (two in LAIV arm and three in control arm) and were excluded from further analysis. Another 8 subjects in the LAIV arm were excluded following a systematic LAIV dispensing error by a single practitioner, as recommended by the trial steering group. This resulted in a final 55 subjects analysed in the LAIV arm and 62 subjects in the control arm. Describe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility of the experimental findings. Key findings, including monocyte recruitment to the nasopharynx were validated in an independent patient cohort. All attempts are replication findings were successful. Describe how samples/organisms/participants were allocated into experimental groups. Using a permuted-block algorithm (1:1, blocks of 10) held in sealed envelopes, participants were randomised to receive either nasal LAIV (Fluenz Tetra or FluMist Tetra, AstraZeneca, UK, used interchangeably due to procurement shortages) paired with intramuscular placebo (0.5ml normal saline), or nasal placebo [control] (0.2ml normal saline) paired with intramuscular Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccination (Fluarix Tetra, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) (see supplemental methods for flu strains).

Low and high months of predicted arrival are 95% prediction intervals, estimated from the regression models from Figure 4 using the predict.lm function of R. Predicted arrivals before 2014 in the low confidence interval were assigned to 01/2015. We note that dates of predicted arrival are based on a simple landscape heterogeneity model of least cost paths from the predicted origin below 3600 meters, which could be overestimates if unidentified landscape barriers exist. Our predictions will lose accuracy if the speed of the epizootic changes and later dates should be re-estimated as new data become available. "

Column 2 shows the value of the statistic for the empirical network (""Sample""). Columns 3 and 4 show the mean (""Mean"") and sample standard deviation (""Std. Dev.""), respectively, of the statistic over simulated networks. Column 5 shows the ""t-ratio"", defined as (observed value-mean value)/standard deviation. For each parameter, using standard methodology, the model is a good fit for the empirical network if the ""t-ratio"" has absolute value less than 0.1 for parameters explicitly in the model (shown in boldface) and less than 2 otherwise.",d7433f2be08b0e833cb270ee2ac736dce1e1a98e,,".2 shows the additional goodness-of-fit results arising from treating the network as multilevel. In particular, results for female-bipartite, male-bipartite, and female-bipartite-male network interactions are shown. All statistics are fit to an acceptable standard. Because the same-sex networks are fixed, graph statistics without bipartite edges show zero variation. The ability of this model specification to closely capture all these features of the empirical network, including ones not explicitly modelled, is strong evidence that a useful model has been specified.

While N-BAR generates membrane tubules, Amph-FL forms highly curved fission vesicles. GUV membrane composition: 79.5 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, and 0.5 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE.

Membrane composition in tethered vesicle experiments: 76 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, and 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, extruded to 200 nm. (A) Representative spinning disc confocal micrographs of GUVs after exposure to 5 µM of either N-BAR (left) or Amph-FL (right). Top: Tubules are visible after less than 10 min of incubating GUVs with protein. Bottom: After more than 1 h, Amph-FL transformed GUVs into small membrane fragments (indicated by red arrowheads) diffusing rapidly in solution. See Video 5. (B) Two representative electron micrographs of tubules generated by 26 µM N-BAR. Dashed boxes indicate zoomed regions to the right of each image. Black arrows indicate tubules. Bars, including insets, 200 nm. (C) Histogram of tubule outer diameters generated by 26 µM N-BAR. Mean = 44 ± 6 nm first SD; n = 323 tubules. (D) Two representative electron micrographs of fission vesicles generated by 5 µM Amph-FL. Dashed boxes indicate zoomed regions to the right of each image. Red arrowheads indicate fission vesicles. Bars, including insets, 200 nm. (E) SUP ER template membrane release experiment comparing Amph-FL and ENTH domain. Dots indicate individual trials and lines indicate the mean of n = 3 trials. (F) Top left: Vesicles after exposure to 300 nM of N-BAR, also shown in Fig. 2 B. Top middle: After detecting puncta using cmeAnalysis (marked with green circles), some large or asymmetric puncta (indicated by red arrows) are included, which may represent tubules. Top right: After applying an extra criterion that excludes puncta greater than 30 pixels in size, the large puncta are no longer included. Left histograms: Vesicle diameter distributions before applying pixel size criterion (same distributions shown in Fig. 2 , C-E). Right histograms: Vesicle diameter distributions after applying pixel size criterion. No substantial shifts in vesicle diameter distribution are apparent after excluding large puncta, suggesting that nondiffraction-limited objects are not substantially shifting the distributions.

(A) Images of 200-nm-extruded tethered vesicles (green, left column) and membrane-bound Amph-FL-Atto 594 (red, right column). Top row is 10 nM; bottom row is 25 nM. Images in each column have equal contrast to show that increasing protein concentration leads to increased membrane-bound protein intensity. Bars, 2 µm. (B) Raw protein intensity as a function of raw vesicle intensity for 10 and 25 nM Amph-FL. (C) The same data in B after processing (see Materials and methods), plotted as the number of membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle diameter. See Fig. 2 , G and H, for membrane coverage data collected using this approach. (D) Membrane binding experiments with the isolated disordered domains of amphiphysin (Amph CTD ΔSH3) and epsin (epsin CTD). Neither disordered domain shows detectable binding to membranes containing PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and phosphatidylserine (PS) used in membrane fission studies. (E-G) Representative, normalized FCS traces of Amph CTD ΔSH3 (E), AP180 CTD (F), and transferrin (G). Blue dots indicate data; black lines indicate fit (see Materials and methods). Average values of diffusion time, τ D , ± first SD are shown next to each trace, with n = 10, 5, and 3 FCS traces for Amph CTD ΔSH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin, respectively. The hydrodynamic radius, R H , of each protein is also shown next to each trace. R H of Amph CTD ΔSH3 was computed by scaling from the known R H of AP180 CTD (Busch et al., 2015 ; see Materials and methods). Using this same approach yields an R H of transferrin that is similar to its expected value (Hall et al., 2002) . (H) Relative diffusion times of Amph CTD ΔSH3 in buffer with 10, 150, and 1,000 mM NaCl, expressed as the proportion of the average diffusion time at 150 mM NaCl. The data indicate a transition from an extended to a more compact state with increasing ionic strength, as expected for charged disordered proteins (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Diffusion times were corrected for changes in solution viscosity with varying NaCl concentration (Zhang and Han, 1996) . Red dots indicate data; black lines indicate mean. n = 5 FCS traces at each NaCl concentration. (I) GUV experiments with 6his peptide. The peptide bound to GUVs but did not drive membrane remodeling.

(J) Images of 200-nm-extruded tethered vesicles (green, left column) and membrane-bound Amph CTD ΔSH3-Atto 594 (red, right column). Top row is 1 µM; bottom row is 2 µM. Images in each column have equal contrast to show greater protein intensity with increasing concentration. Bars, 2 µm. (K) Raw protein intensity as a function of raw vesicle intensity for the 1 µM Amph CTD ΔSH3 dataset. (L) The same 1 µM Amph CTD ΔSH3 dataset after processing, plotted as the area occupied by membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle surface area. The slope of a linear fit to the data represents the average membrane coverage by proteins. See Number of tubes per cell as a function of protein expression level, quantified as the background-subtracted protein intensity in the cytosol 1 µm above the plasma membrane (see Materials and methods). The plot is similar to Fig. 4 C, which plots protein expression level on the x-axis as the protein intensity at the plasma membrane. Lines indicate linear regression with y-intercept set to 0. Shaded regions indicate 99% CI. Line color matches the respective marker color. (C) Relative binding of proteins to the plasma membrane, quantified as the ratio of the average protein intensity in the cytosol to the average protein intensity at the plasma membrane.

Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD show slightly higher ratios compared with N-BAR, suggesting that disordered domains may have hindered plasma membrane binding somewhat.

P values: unpaired, two-tailed Student's t tests. These data indicate the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote fission of lipid tubules in live cells by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Figure S5 .

The proteolytic cleavage site was added to allow the specific removal of the tag for structural studies. We avoided the use of cysteine proteases (like Prescission, TEV or 3C proteases) which, although are very specific, require a reducing agent for activity, which could also reduce some of the exposed disulfides of the glycoprotein. We instead engineered an enterokinase (EK) cleavage site, which is a serine-protease relatively specific for the sequence (Asp) 4 Lys↓X, cleaving at the site indicated by the arrow with a cleavage efficiency between 60 and 80 % (X being any amino acid) [4] . This resulted in the following amino acid sequence downstream of the ApaI and BstBI sites ...DDDDKAGWSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGGSWSHPQFEK-COOH. All synthetic HCV glycoprotein genes were purchased from GeneCust (Dudelange, Luxemburg) and amplified by PCR using strain specific 5'-oligonucleotides containing Bgl II, which allows insertion immediately downstream of the BiP secretion signal, and strain specific 3'-oligonucleotides containing Apa I. A full list of oligonucleotides used in this study is available upon request Transfection  For large scale production of E2e the cells were cultured in spinner flasks or in Wave Bioreactors (2/10, Wave Biotech, Somerset, USA) and induced with 4µM CdCl 2 at a density of approximately 7x10 6 cells per ml. After 8 days at 28°C cells were pelleted and E2e was purified by affinity chromatography from the supernatant using a StrepTactin Superflow column (IBA, Goettingen, Germany) followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Pure protein was quantified using adsorption at UV 280nm and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml. 25µg of H77 E2e and 70µg of either mAb H53 or CBH-4D, respectively, were incubated as isolated proteins as well as in complex for 1h at 10°C followed by analysis on a Superdex200 Mini column (column volume 3 ml, Amersham). 25µg of E2e was bound to a StrepTactin Superflow mini column (column volume 0.2ml) and washed with 10 column volumes of washing buffer. Subsequently, 10µg of CD81 large extracellular loop (produced as described before [5] ) or 50µg of conformation dependent antibodies CBH-4B, CBH-4D against HCV E2 (kindly provided by S. Foung, Stanford, USA) or a control antibody were added, followed by washing with 10 column volumes. Complexes were eluted in 4.5 column volumes elution buffer and concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration. This concentrate was analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Huh7.5 cells plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (4. Secondary structure contents were estimated from the far-UV CD spectra using the CDSSTR routine [6] of the DICHROWEB server [7, 8] run on the SP175 reference dataset [9] , containing 72 proteins representing a large panel of secondary structures. Similar results were obtained on different datasets [10] or by using the CONTIN/LL routine [11] . Soluble HCV E2 and Dengue virus 3 E protein in a concentration of 5-10mg/ml in After 8h, 0.25µg of trypsin were added and the digestion was continued for another 16h. The peptides were eluted from the gel using 200µl water and two times 100µl 60% Acetonitril. As a control, the trypsin digestion experiment was carried out as described above, but in the presence of 5% DMSO, acting as oxidizing agent. The deglycosylated 8 protein was analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto a Nitrocellulose membrane and staining with Poinceau-Red. Bands containing approximately 15µg E2e were cut out of the membrane and saturated with 1ml of 0.2% PVP K30 for 15 minutes followed by six washes, four with water and two with 50mM TrisHCl pH 7.6. Subsequently the protein was digested with 1µg Trypsin for 3h at 37°C in the absence or presence of 5mM NEM. The peptides were eluted from the membrane using 200µl of water. The tryptic digest was divided in two half fractions. One half was submitted directly to reverse-phase HPLC using DEAE-C18 columns (1mm diameter) and a gradient  N-terminal sequencing was performed using a ABI 494 Protein Sequencer (Applied ChipReader System 4000 using a H4 (reversed phase, Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA, USA) surface and a SPA matrix, which was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peak identification was carried out using ProteinChip Software 3.1 (Ciphergen). Molecular weight prediction of disulfide-connected peptides was performed using MS-BRIDGE [12] , while molecular weight of reduced peptides was predicted using PeptideMass [13] . In order to identify the disulfide bridges of HCV E2e we first performed a tryptic digestion of E2e of the JFH-1 isolate. The HPLC chromatogram of the resulting digest revealed peaks 6-3, 12-3 and 16-3 to be TCEP sensitive and disappear upon reduction. Peak 6-3 revealed a mixture of peptides, the N-terminal sequencing of which showed that only J1 and J2 (Table S1 and Fig. S3A ) contained a cysteine residue (position 452 and 459, respectively). In the respective mass spectrum a peak corresponding to the disulfide linked dipeptide could be identified (1471.71 Da), which disappeared upon reduction (Fig. S3A) , indicating a disulfide bridge between Cys452 and Cys459. Peak 12-3 contained peptides J6 and J7, each of them with one cysteine (position 607 and 644, respectively). While peptides J6 and J7 were found as single peptides in the mass spectrum, indicating partial reduction, we also observed a peak at the predicted molecular weight of the two peptides linked by a disulfide bond (Fig. S3A,   2045 .37 Da). This peak disappeared, as expected, upon reduction. This clearly suggested a disulfide bridge between Cys607 and Cys644. Peak 16-3 contained a mixture of peptides with one dominant sequence corresponding to peptide J4, containing two cysteines (position 503 and 508, respectively) and a proline residue in between. This peptide was unambiguously identified in the mass spectrum of peak 16-3 (Fig. 5B, Fig. S3B and Table S1 , 2341.37 Da). Reduction with TCEP resulted in a molecular weight shift by 2 Da, which was interpreted as two hydrogen atoms added upon reduction of the cysteines, demonstrating an intrapeptidic disulfide bridge between Cys503 and Cys508. Two more peptides, which could not be observed by mass spectrometry, were identified by N-terminal sequencing in peak 16-3: peptide J3 and peptide J5, containing Cys486 and Cys494 as well as Cys581 and Cys585, respectively. Subsequently we subjected the E2e from isolate UKN2b_2.8 to trypsin digestion. HPLC separation of the resulting peptides revealed that peaks 13-1, 20-1, 29-3, 42-observed by N-terminal sequencing in all three control experiments (data not shown), strongly suggesting that it is also present in the native protein. Peak 20-1 contained exclusively peptide U3, which corresponds to peptide J4 in JFH-1 E2e, thereby confirming the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys503 and Cys508 (Table S1 and Fig. S3C, 2194 .94 Da). Analysis of peak 29-3 revealed two TCEP sensitive peptides, U2 and U3. We had identified U3 previously to carry an internal disulfide bridge, thus suggesting an additional internal disulfide bond between Cys486 and Cys494 in peptide U2. Cys552. Although the disulfide linked peptides could not be identified by mass spectrometry, upon reduction a peak corresponding to the reduced peptide U1 was observed (Fig. S3D , 2308 Da). Likely the high molecular weight of the disulfide linked dipeptide (U1 + U4 -6890.68 Da) prevented its appearance in the spectrum. One peak (19-1) was found to contain a mixture of sequences, with one dominant sequence corresponding to peptide U5, in which two cysteines (position 581 and 585) are present. We observed a peak corresponding to the peptide harboring an intrapeptidic disulfide bridge in the mass spectrum (Table S1 and Fig. S3D, 1849.64 Da). Reduction resulted as expected in an increase of the molecular weight by 2 Da. In addition, peptide U2 was found in the same peak, which has previously been shown to carry an intrapeptidic disulfide bond. Finally, we performed a tryptic digestion of the of E2e of H77 followed by HPLC of the resulting peptides, which revealed that peaks 15-2, 6-2, 26-2, 32-2, 43-2 and 33-2 disappeared upon reduction. Peptides H5 and H6, which correspond to J6/ J7 and U6/ U7 were identified in peak 15-2. For both E2 of JFH-1 and UKN2b_2.8 a disulfide bridge between the respective cysteines (position 607 and 644) was shown in this study. Mass spectrometry clearly demonstrated the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys607 and Cys644 in the ectodomain of H77 E2 as well (Table S1 and Fig. S3E , Peptide H1 was found in two different peaks. Together with peptide H2, which corresponds to peptide J2, it was observed in peak 6-2, suggesting the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys452 and Cys459, which has already been identified in E2e from strain JFH-1. A peak in the mass spectrum corresponding to this peptide confirmed the presence of this disulfide bond (Fig. S3E, 1544 .29 Da). However, peptide H1 was also found together with peptide H6 in peak 26-2, which clearly suggested a disulfide rearrangement for these cysteines (Fig. S3F) Peak 43-2 consisted of the peptides H7 and H8, each containing one cysteine residue (position 652 and 677, respectively). In the mass spectrum we observed a peak corresponding to the disulfide linked dipeptide (Fig. S3G and Table S1 , 6849.91 Da), unambiguously identifying a disulfide bridge between Cys652 and Cys677 in the ectodomain of H77 E2. Comparing the sequence alignment of E2 in the region between Cys569 and Cys581 we noticed that while UKN2b_2.8 and JFH-1 E2 contain three trypsin cleavage sites, H77 E2 has no cleavage sites in this region (Fig. S2 ). Thus trypsin cleavage prediction in this region resulted in one peptide containing 4 cysteines, aligned sequentially in a way that the first two cysteines and the last two each have a proline residue in between. Analysis of peak 33-2 revealed only peptide H4, which corresponds to the predicted peptide containing 4 cysteines (positions 564, 569, 581 and 585, respectively). Mass spectrometry revealed a peak matching the predicted mass of this peptide containing two intrapeptidic disulfide bridges (Fig.   S3G , 2504.50 Da). Under non-reducing conditions two minor peaks could be observed, which are shifted by exactly 2 Da and thus likely correspond to partially reduced peptides in the original HPLC peak. Since we had already identified the disulfide bond between Cys581 and Cys585 in UKN2b_2.8 E2, this result strongly indicates the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys564 and Cys569."
