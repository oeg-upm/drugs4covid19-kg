# 2. Immunostimulants related to COVID-19
Documents that mention inmunostimulants (ATC code L03A) and all of the ATCs in lower levels and the disease COVID-19 
We should add “and related diseases” if the annotation “mapping” which corresponds to related diseases is mapped to the KG. 
This query can be ranked, the results with more specific levels in the ATC codes can appear first.
Motivation: Documents that mention the BCG vaccine (ATC code L03AX03) (vaccine against the tuberculosis Bacteria) because there are studies that link the vaccine with partial immunization  to COVID-19.

#3. Diseases related to drugs that combine  immunosuppressant  and antimalarial activities with macrolide antibiotics
Paragraphs with drugs that combine immunosuppressant  and antimalarial activities with macrolide antibiotics, the diseases that appear in these paragraphs, and the title and problem of the corresponding paper. 
Use case last hackaton.
We probably can get more information from diseases once the KG is created.
The drugs that combine  immunosuppressant  and antimalarial activities have the active ingredient P01BA02.
The macrolide antibiotics belong to the therapeutic group  J01FA;

2. Future queries for KG with crowd annotations.


#1. Diseases that  are contraindicated by drugs that combine  immunosuppressant  and antimalarial activities with macrolide antibiotics mentioned
Paragraphs with drugs that combine immunosuppressant  and antimalarial activities with macrolide antibiotics, the disorders  that are treated by these drugs, the disorders for which these drugs are counterindicated, and the title and problem of the corresponding paper. 
Query #3 with annotations on drugs that treat disorders and diseases counterindicated by these drugs.
Similarly Query #4, 5 and 6 could also be improved with further annotations. 




# 2.  Diseases that are contraindicated by drugs used to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. fever, dry cough and respiratory impairments)
Which are the disorders that are counterindicated by the active ingredients used to treat fever, dry cough and respiratory impairments.
Query proposed by a general user


#3. Drugs used against COVID-19 that include corticoids 
Which are the drugs that include corticoids used against COVID-19 that have as effect the CPOD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) lung disease.
This query was proposed by a medical doctor. It is of interest because corticids are applied as treatment for COVID-19 and doctors want to know if the patient in the future will have the CPOD disease.


#4. Effects of hidroxicloriquina
 Which are the effects that may be produced by the active principle Hidroxicloriquina
Query proposed by a medical doctor Guides the doctor to know previous tests that should be done to the patient before applying the treatment, that could predict that those effects could take place.
